US Census County Statistics Extract for Database

Author: Rob Lind

census_extract.rb
-----------------
This application will extract data from US Census site for each county in the US and produce INSERTs for database table.
  For each record in the input file US_FIPS_Codes a page hit will be made to US Census site to get that county's statistics.
  An output file will be created for the range selected at prompt.

Note: this run does not function perfectly but unable to identify why some census pages are not retrieved successfully. I fixed the problems by 
 extracting the FIPS NOT in the database after full table load (using NOT EXISTS query) and reran those FIPS codes correctly then loading that additional small set.
 Here is that existential query: select fipscd from fips_st_cnty a where not exists (select fipscd from countystats b where a.fipscd = b.fipscd);

Directories/Files Required
 Dir: ../data
 File: ../data/US_FIPS_Codes.csv [source: www.schooldata.com/pdfs/US_FIPS_Codes.xls]

To Run
 Run the program with ruby
 At prompt enter range xxx-yyy - suggest blocks of approx 500 in order to limit load file sizes
 Take care not to overlap range values from one run to next or you will end up with duplicate sets of data
